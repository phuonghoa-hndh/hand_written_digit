Handwritten Digits Recognition using Evolutionary Algorithms
This repository contains a Python project that implements handwritten digits recognition using evolutionary algorithms. 
The goal of this project is to develop a system that can recognize and classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using evolutionary algorithms.

Introduction

The main components of this project include:
1. Genetic Algorithm: The genetic algorithm is used to evolve a population of neural networks over generations.
Each neural network is represented as a chromosome in the genetic algorithm, and the genetic operators (crossover, mutation) are applied to create new generations of neural networks.
2. Neural Network Architecture: We use a simple feedforward neural network architecture for recognizing digits.
The architecture includes an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.
3. Fitness Function: The fitness function evaluates how well a neural network can recognize digits. It measures the accuracy of the network on a validation dataset.
4. MNIST Dataset: We use the MNIST dataset, a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), for training and testing the neural networks.
